## Hello, there!

Well, I'm a programmer who started exploring computing in 2016, I was 16 years old, but explored it generically, subjects like hacking, operating systems, and sometimes as a hobby, I wrote simple programs to solve some math exams in high school. But to be honest with you, it was only in 2020 that I decided to get deeper into programming for making real-world applications.

So, today I am a backend developer and always exploring other concepts and technologies to solidify the principles of computer programming and have fun, like in code marathons.
