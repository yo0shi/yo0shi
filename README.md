Hello, I'm Josias Costa Oliveira! 🙋🏽‍♂️

I really started studying programming in 2018, but since 2016 I and my great friends have been talking about cybersecurity and IT. 📚

🔻I'm coding and studying some concepts, such as:

    ✔️ Propositional Logic

    ✔️ Algorithm Analysis

    ✔️ Data Structures

    ✔️ Web Development (particularly on the back-end)

    ✔️ Network analysis of IP/TCP traffic

🔻Programming Languages:

    ✔️ C
    ✔️ Python
    ✔️ JS
    ✔️ PHP

And, in 2021, today, I'm playing hackathons and coding marathons, I was at the Recode Pro 2021 hackathon and HackerRank.
